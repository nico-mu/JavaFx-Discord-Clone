# Accord

Accord is the client you'll need to communicate with your peers and friends via the Accord-Server.

## Getting Started

Grab the latest application state from our GitHub repository, create a new branch from the master following our naming
conventions and start coding!

It is advised that you use the buildRouteMap Gradle-Task on evey pull of the master branch. You'll create the latest
RouteMapping and allow the routing system to work properly.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* Java 11+ AdoptOpenJDK (HotSpot) 11.0.1 is recommended
* JavaFX Scene Builder 11.0.0
* An IDE that will make your coding much easier IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2021.1.1 is recoomended
* Oh, and don't forget a warm cup of coffee

### Server

* [Release 1 documentation](https://seblog.cs.uni-kassel.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ServerdokuR1.pdf)

### Branches

* Master: The latest working version and can only be edited by the ScrumMaster
* Feature: WIP tasks, that will be merged into the master once finished by creating a pull request
* Bugfix: Any bugfix
* Other: Can contain basically anything else.

Please let your branches have a speaking name, so everyone knows what to expect. If the branch you created is a
temporary one, it is your responsibility to delete it at the end of each sprint or provide an explanation why it must be
present on the remote!
